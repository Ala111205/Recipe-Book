**🍲 Recipe Book Web Application**

      The Recipe Book Web Application is a frontend-focused web project built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
      
      It allows users to add, view, search, and manage recipes through a clean and user-friendly interface.

      Each recipe includes a name, ingredients, preparation steps, and an image of the finished dish. The application emphasizes strong frontend fundamentals, asynchronous JavaScript handling, and integration with third-party cloud services.
